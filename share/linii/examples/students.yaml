        1.Construct an atlas of 2 maps for $S^2$.
        2.Verify that $(f\circ g)_* = f_*\circ g_*$.
        3.Verify that $(\omega_1\wedge\omega_2)\wedge\omega_3 = \omega_1\wedge(\omega_2\wedge\omega_3)$

        1.Associativity of the wedge-product for 2-form wedge 1-form wedge 1-form
        2.Verify that the integral of $\omega$ over the boundary of a small parallelepiped equals $d\omega$ on the vectors generating the parallelepiped
        3.Prove that $p\partial + \partial p = \mbox{id}$ where $p$ is the cone operation
      hw3_note: |
        1.Consider the phase flow corresponding to $v(x) = x^2$, namely $g^t(x) = {x\over 1-tx}$. Show by an explicit calculation, that this is a 1-parameter group.
        2.Compute the flow of $v(x) = x^n$.
        3.The phase flow of $v(x,y) = (-y,x)$.
        4.Show in coordinates that ${\cal L}_v (\omega(\xi)) = ({\cal L}_v \omega)(\xi) + \omega({\cal L}_v \xi)$
        5.Show in coordinates that $[d,{\cal L}_v] = 0$
        6.Verify that $\mbox{exp}(tx^2\partial_x) x = {x\over 1-tx}$ by expanding in powers of $t$.
