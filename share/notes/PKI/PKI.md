Instructions from [JamieLinux](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/index.html)



Setting up Root CA
==================

As described on [JamieLinux](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/create-the-root-pair.html)


Create an intermediate authority
================================

Again, as described in [JamieLinux](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/create-the-intermediate-pair.html)

Instead of `intermediate` use some reasonable name such as `myvpn`
