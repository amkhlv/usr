Only the latest works (1.4.2).

Only one command can be executed. 
After each command, reboot BOTH computer and phone. 

USB connector should be inserted AFTER starting Odin.

Notice that Odin is one thing, and TWRP another.
To boot into Odin, `PowerHomeVolDn`, and to boot into TWRP: `PowerHomeVolUp`

Original installed system usually removes TWRP on each boot.
Thus, avoid system boot until installed LineageOS.
