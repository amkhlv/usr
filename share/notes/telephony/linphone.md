To call landline
================

With Zadarma.com
----------------

In address line (which says "Search a contact, start a call...")
type number starting with `+` (such as `+5511...`) and press `ENTER`.
It seems that this corresponds to the address:

    sip:+5511...@sip.zadarma.com

Using Linphone requies LTE/4G signal, I think it would not work over WiFi.
