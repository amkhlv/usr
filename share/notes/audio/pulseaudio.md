Starting and stopping
=====================

To stop:

    pulseaudio -k

To start in verbose diagnostic mode:

    pulseaudio -vvvv

To start as a daemon:

    pulseaudio -D

To check status:

    pulseaudio --check
    echo $?

(`0` means running, `1` means not running)

From "[confusing-defuzzing](http://colin.guthr.ie/2009/08/sound-on-linux-is-confusing-defuzzing-part-2-pulseaudio/)":

The first thing a PulseAudio client has to do is connect to a server.
In order to do this, it checks various variables and configuration files to determine precisely to __which__ server it will connect!

Initially, the PulseAudio client library looks for a `PULSE_SERVER` environment variable.
If found, this variable can define a list of servers to which the client should connect.
These servers can be specified as local UNIX sockets or DNS names/IP addresses for a TCP connection.

Assuming it's still not got a server to connect to yet, PulseAudio will check for a default-server
configuration in it's `client.conf` file. This file is located in either `/etc/pulse/` or `~/.pulse/`
(Only one of the client.conf files is parsed. So if the user has their own one, the system one will not be parsed at all.)


Forwarding across network
=========================

This requires the availability on `MachineB` of the `UNIX socket`:

    /run/user/1000/pulse/native

We will first explain how to obtain this socket


Obtaining UNIX socket
---------------------

Usually, `PulseAudio` uses `shm` istead of `UNIX socket`, so it is not available. This means that we need to __disable the use of shm__ by `PulseAudio`.

As I [explained previously](#sectionColinGuthr) , this can be done by creating the file `/home/andrei/.pulse/` and putting a line in it:

    disable-shm=yes

Moreover, I need to export the environment variable:

    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000

and make sure that it exists and has right permissions:

    mkdir -p /run/user/1000/pulse
    chown -R andrei:andrei /run/user/1000

(I usually do it in `~/.bashrc`)

Then, after the restart of `PulseAudio`, we get that `UNIX socket` available. 

Tunnel
------

Suppose that `MachineA` (server) needs to run an application with sound but does not have speakers, while
`MachineB` (client) has speakers.

We modify the description on [Joshua Taubererâ€™s Blog](https://razor.occams.info/blog/2009/02/11/pulseaudio-sound-forwarding-across-a-network/)
by running port forwarding in reverse and using the standard on Debian `PulseAudio` socket `/run/user/1000/pulse/native`:

On `MachineB` (client):

    ssh -N -f -R4000:localhost:4000 machineA.com
    socat TCP-LISTEN:4000,fork,range=127.0.0.1/32 UNIX-CONNECT:/run/user/1000/pulse/native

(__notice that__ the range restriction `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32` imposes a restriction on the __remote__ address __from where__ comes the connection;
this particular example  is very confusing because it creates the [remote port forwarding](../server/ssh.html) which is __incoming tunnel__)

On `MachineA` (server):

    PULSE_SERVER=localhost:4000  mysoundapplication


Authentication
--------------

I think it authenticates with a cookie. The file:

    ~/.config/pulse/cookie

should be __same on client and server__
