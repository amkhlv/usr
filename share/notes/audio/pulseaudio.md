Starting and stopping
=====================

To stop:

    pulseaudio -k

To start in verbose diagnostic mode:

    pulseaudio -vvvv

To start as a daemon:

    pulseaudio -D

To check status:

    pulseaudio --check
    echo $?

(`0` means running, `1` means not running)

From "[confusing-defuzzing](http://colin.guthr.ie/2009/08/sound-on-linux-is-confusing-defuzzing-part-2-pulseaudio/)":

The first thing a PulseAudio client has to do is connect to a server.
In order to do this, it checks various variables and configuration files to determine precisely to __which__ server it will connect!

Initially, the PulseAudio client library looks for a `PULSE_SERVER` environment variable.
If found, this variable can define a list of servers to which the client should connect.
These servers can be specified as local UNIX sockets or DNS names/IP addresses for a TCP connection.

Assuming it's still not got a server to connect to yet, PulseAudio will check for a default-server
configuration in it's `client.conf` file. This file is located in either `/etc/pulse/` or `~/.pulse/`
(Only one of the client.conf files is parsed. So if the user has their own one, the system one will not be parsed at all.)


Forwarding across network
=========================

This requires the availability on `MachineB` of the `UNIX socket`:

    /run/user/1000/pulse/native

We will first explain how to obtain this socket


Obtaining UNIX socket
---------------------

Usually, `PulseAudio` uses `shm` istead of `UNIX socket`, so it is not available. This means that we need to __disable the use of shm__ by `PulseAudio`.

As I [explained previously](#sectionColinGuthr) , this can be done by creating the file `/home/andrei/.pulse/daemon.conf` and putting a line in it:

    disable-shm=yes

Moreover, I need to export the environment variable:

    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000

and make sure that it exists and has right permissions:

    mkdir -p /run/user/1000/pulse
    chown -R andrei:andrei /run/user/1000

(I usually do it in `~/.bashrc`)

Then, after the restart of `PulseAudio`, we get that `UNIX socket` available. 

Tunnel
------

Suppose that `MachineA` (server) needs to run an application with sound but does not have speakers, while
`MachineB` (client) has speakers.

We modify the description on [Joshua Taubererâ€™s Blog](https://razor.occams.info/blog/2009/02/11/pulseaudio-sound-forwarding-across-a-network/)
by running port forwarding in reverse and using the standard on Debian `PulseAudio` socket `/run/user/1000/pulse/native`:

On `MachineB` (client):

    ssh -N -f -R4000:localhost:4000 machineA.com
    socat TCP-LISTEN:4000,fork,range=127.0.0.1/32 UNIX-CONNECT:/run/user/1000/pulse/native

(__notice that__ the range restriction `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32` imposes a restriction on the __remote__ address __from where__ comes the connection;
this particular example  is very confusing because it creates the [remote port forwarding](../server/ssh.md) which is __incoming tunnel__)

On `MachineA` (server):

    PULSE_SERVER=localhost:4000  mysoundapplication


Authentication
--------------

I think it authenticates with a cookie. The file:

    ~/.config/pulse/cookie

should be __same on client and server__


CLI
===

Main commands
-------------

The main command is `pacmd` ; the most useful subcommands to start with are:

    pacmd help

and

    pacmd dump

The second one, `pacmd dump`, is very nice: it prints a list of lines which need to be input (prefixed with `pacmd`) to arrive at the current state.
For example `set-sink-volume alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo 0xdeae` is achieved by executing:

    pacmd set-sink-volume alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo 0xdeae

Moving sources and sinks
------------------------

Suppose that I have some application running (like `Firefox`) and I want to transfer its audio output stream over Internet.

I execute [amkhlv_gstpipe.py](../../../bin/amkhlv_gstpipe.py) to establish a `gstreamer` pipe to some remote location.
The entry of this pipe is linked to some `pulseaudio` output, which outputs audio from some source. To figure out what
is this source output, execute:

    pacmd list-source-outputs

As far as I understand, this actually __lists pairs__ `(source-output,client)`. In particular, `amkhlv_gstpipe.py` is listed,
let us say, under `index: 4`:

    index: 4
        ...
        properties:
                media.name = "Record Stream"
                application.name = "amkhlv_gstpipe.py"

In fact, I can separately list clients:

    pacmd list-clients

This would list all clients, __index__-ed by a number, one of them will have `application.name = "amkhlv_gstpipe.py"` --- this is my pipe.
Now, returning to `list-source-outputs`, by looking at the output I can figure out that it receives from, for example, 
`source: 1 <alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo>`     (which is actually a microphone, as we can see from the word ``input'').
This means that, at the moment, the remote machine is listening to our microphone... 

Instead, I want to feed it the output from the running `Firefox` (maybe YouTube...). So, I look again at the output of `list-source-outputs`,
and I see that it includes some `source: 0 <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor>` . This is, actually, the ``monitor''
(a side channel) of the audio card output. So, I have to move __4__ from __1__ to __0__ :

    pacmd move-source-output 4 0

And, if I want to move it back to the microphone, I execute:

    pacmd move-source-output 4 1

Similarly, there are commands `list-sink-inputs` and `move-sink-input`.

The __GUI__ for all this is `pavucontrol`

Virtual sound card
------------------

    modprobe snd-aloop

creates a virtual sound card called `Loopback 1`
