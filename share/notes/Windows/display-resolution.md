How to fix the display resolution
=================================

Symptom: the optimal resolution of your monitor is not listed in the Windows control panel.

Solution: download the program called `PowerStrip` from [Entech Taiwan](http://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/ps.shtm) and install it.
The program will request the reboot. The reboot will be slow, with black screen showing for a few minutes.
Then the correct resolution should be detected.
