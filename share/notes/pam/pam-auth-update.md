Introduction
============

The files in `/etc/pam.d` are actually auto-generated by `pam-auth-update`. Therefore, it is not right to edit them directly.
Instead, one should configure profiles and then run `pam-auth-update`.

Configuring profiles
====================

They are in `/usr/share/pam-configs/`

Just create your custom profile as a new file with more or less arbitrary name.

But before, probably need to remove the corresponding default profile. For example, we create the new file `pam_script_amkhlv` which
is supposed to replace the default `pam_script`. Then we do:

    pam-auth-update --remove pam_script
    rm pam_script
    pam-auth-update

Now go to `/etc/pam.d` and check.
