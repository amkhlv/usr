Global settings
===============

They are in `~/.stack/global-project/`

To install a package, go to some directory which is not a `stack` project (_i.e._ `~`) and type:

     stack install packagename



VSCode Haskero
==============

It sometimes happens that `Haskero` cannot find a package (the word "import" gets redlined).
The fix is: click on `Targets` in the lower right corner of the window and change to `All targets`
