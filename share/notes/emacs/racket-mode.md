Installing
==========

The following three should be locally cloned:

    git clone https://github.com/Lindydancer/faceup
    git clone https://github.com/magnars/s.el
    git clone https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode

And then, in `emacs.el` :

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/melpa/s.el/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/melpa/faceup/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/melpa/racket-mode/")
