Sending files via DCC
=====================

Press the __send file__ button in the right bottom corner.

This is via direct TCP client-to-client. The one __to whom__ the file is sent becomes the server.

Choosing the port range
-----------------------

Go to `Setting` → `Preferences` → `File transfer` and under `Network settings` choose some
`First DCC send port` equal to `Last DCC send port` equal to some reasonable port number.
Then have to open that port in the firewall.
