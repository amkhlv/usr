Installation
============

Follow [instructions here](https://fosspost.org/tutorials/install-android-6-0-marshmallow-linux-run-apps-games)

In particular:

1. Do NOT choose `GPT`

1. Do not forget the `boot` flag

2. When asked to choose whether to reboot or start using Android, here actually you have to choose none of those options, just close the QEMU window without doing anything, force shutdown, and start again (make sure that `.iso` is disconnected)


Peculiarities
=============

If `Android` freezes, it can be unstuck by `Shut Down` (but not `Forced Off`!), I guess this is ACPI shutdown

To __Shut Down__ do virtual machine `Shut Down`, it will bring up a nice shutdown menu.
