Over socket
===========

The `X11` server listens on the Unix Domain Socket `/tmp/.X11-unix/X0`. In this case we should put `DISPLAY=:0` (or `DISPLAY=:0.0`;
the second `0` enumerates the screens of this display, in case of [multihead display](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/multihead)).


(The `DISPLAY` variable starting with `:` means that it is Unix Domain Socket)

Over ssh
========

Location of server port
-----------------------

When forwarding via  `ssh -X`, the `sshd` (on the `ssh`-server side) starts listening on the `ssh`-server's `localhost:(6000 + N)` where `N`
is determined by `X11DisplayOffset` variable in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (usually `N=10`, so it is `6010`).
In this case, the `DISPLAY` should be `localhost:10.0`; the `sshd` sets this value automatically.

(The `DISPLAY` variable starting with a hostname means `X11` over network. In this particular case, over port `6010` on `localhost`.
The `ssh` forwards it to the actual X11 server running on the `ssh`-client machine.)
