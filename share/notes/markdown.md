Tags and links within document
==============================

Suppose that I want to create a link to a section. Then I should put, at some point near the title:

    <a name="sectionExample"></a>

and then I can refer it later:

    see [Example Section](#sectionExample)

(And, to refer from another page, I will be able to use the address `http://some/page.html#sectionExample`)

see [Tags and Links Section](#sectionTagsAndLinksWithin)
