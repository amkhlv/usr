    exit 0

Structure of /etc/config/wireless
=================================


This file defines Wi-Fi radios and Wi-Fi interfaces.

## config wifi-device

Represents a physical radio (phy0, phy1, â€¦).

Options include:

    option type 'mac80211'      # driver framework
    option path 'platform/...'  # hardware bus path
    option band '2g' or '5g'
    option channel '6'          # fixed channel (avoid 'auto')
    option country 'BR'
    option htmode 'HT20' / 'VHT80' / etc.
    option disabled '0'         # 1 = disabled, 0 = enabled


## config wifi-iface

Represents a logical Wi-Fi interface on a radio (AP, client, mesh).

Options include:

    option device 'radio0'      # attach to which wifi-device
    option mode 'ap'            # ap = Access Point, sta = Client
    option ssid 'MyWiFi'
    option encryption 'psk2'    # WPA2
    option key 'SecretPass'
    option network 'lan'        # binds to a network in /etc/config/network


ðŸ‘‰ Multiple wifi-iface sections can exist on the same wifi-device.
Example: one radio hosting both a main SSID and a guest SSID.
