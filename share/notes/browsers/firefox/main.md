Tab loss
========

Tab loss happens in case when `Firefox` is autostarted (by opening an `html` link e.g. from `Evolution`, while `Firefox` is not running).

This can be restored, see [Session restore](#session-restore)


Session restore
===============

When `Firefox` quits, the state is saved in the profile folder in the file `sessionstore.js`

Previous sessions are stored in `sessionstore-backups/`
