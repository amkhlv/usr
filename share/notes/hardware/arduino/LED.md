For most of LEDs the optimal current is between 10 and 20 mA. 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_circuit) : 

    Typically, the forward voltage of an LED is between 1.8 and 3.3 volts. 
    It varies by the color of the LED. A red LED typically drops 1.8 volts, 
    but voltage drop normally rises as the light frequency increases, 
    so a blue LED may drop from 3 to 3.3 volts.
