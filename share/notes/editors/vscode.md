[FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting)

To summarize:

1. From File > Preferences > Settings  search for `telemetry.enableCrashReporter` and uncheck the setting.

2. There are others: From File > Preferences > Settings  search for `@tag:usesOnlineServices`. This will display all settings that control the usage of online services and you can individually switch them on or off.
