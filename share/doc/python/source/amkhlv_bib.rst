==========

.. automodule:: amkhlv_bib

My bibliography builder. The command line parameters are::

  -l or --list dumps on stdout
  -p or --pdf  output as AMbib.pdf in /home/andrei/a/Jobs/proposal+publications/AMbib.pdf

To choose the criteria, edit headers
in the `source file <file:///home/andrei/bin/amkhlv_bib.py>`_ using ``gvim`` then
type ``:!python %`` and then see the `generated pdf file <file:///home/andrei/a/Jobs/proposal+publications/AMbib.pdf>`_
or if you need the ``bibTeX`` labels, see the `generated TeX file <file:///home/andrei/a/Jobs/proposal+publications/AMbib.tex>`_
