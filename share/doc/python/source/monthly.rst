monthly
=======

.. automodule:: monthly

My monthly reminder. It does not need any command line arguments.

The allowed values of the `months` field are one of the following:

- "all"
- "even"
- "odd"
- comma-separated integers, e.g. "3,7,8" for March, July and August

The allowed values of the `days` field are comma-separated integers from 1 to 27
