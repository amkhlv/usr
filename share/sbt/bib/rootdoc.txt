This is a script to create the pdf file of the selected bibliography

To run, say: `activator run`

All the necessary parameters are fixed in `resources/specs.yaml` ; notice that there are several YAML files
in `resources/` , so one of them should be symlinked to `specs.yaml` ; the parameters are:

 - `regexTitle`    : this is a list of all regexes in the title which should match
 - `regexAuthors`    : this is a list of all regexes on the authors which should match
 - `regexTitleExclude` : this is a list of all regexes on the title which should be excluded
 - `autodir`  : this is the directory where all the LaTeX and PDF files will appear
 - `autofile` : this should be a reasonably exotic filename (no extension!)
 - `bibfile`  : path to the main bibliography file
 - `bibstyle` : e.g. `jhep` ; this means that the file `jhep.bst` '''should be present''' in the `autodir`

 So, ''' be careful when cleaning the autodir '''

 For some very strange reason, I have to modify the file `/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf`
 replacing `openout_any = p` with `openout_any = a`
